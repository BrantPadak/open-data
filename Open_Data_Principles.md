# Open Data: 8 Principles
(source: https://opengovdata.org)

### Complete

* Bulk data format (so entire dataset can be acquired) - not only via API or page-by-page viewing
* Made available (if it is not subject to privacy, security, or privilege limitations)
* Assets made electronically available whenever possible


### Primary

* Collected at the source
* Highest possible level of granularity (not in aggregate or modified forms)


### Timely

* Made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data


### Accessible

* Made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes via the internet
* Accessible to disabled people
* Not software platform-specific
* Published with current industry standard protocols and formats (e.g. JSON, CSV, Socrata, Shapefile)
* NOT accessible if only retrievable through navigating web forms, or if automated tools are not permitted access because of robots.txt file (or other policy/technological restrictions)


### Machine Processable

* Reasonably structured so a computer can easily process it without human intervention
* Unique identifiers (reference numbers used to identify unique individuals, entities or locations) are used within and across data sets --> improves the quality and accuracy of data analysis
* Properly encoded: tabular and normalized when necessary (images of text are not a substitute for the text itself)
* Sufficient documentation on the data format and meanings of normalized data items must be available to users of the data
* Should be in formats & approaches that promote analysis and reuse of the data (the public should be able to carry out their own analysis on the data)


### Non-discriminatory

* Available to anyone, with no requirement of registration
* Anonymous access to the data must be allowed for public data, including access through anonymous proxies (should not be hidden behind "walled gardens")

### Non-proprietary

* Available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control


### License-free

* not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation (Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed)
* Data for which no restrictions apply should be marked clearly as being in the public domain
