"Major Roads (Atlanta, GA)","This layer was developed by the Research & Analytics Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission and is a subset of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (GDOT) DLGF street centerline database. The features included in this Layer consist of all State highways in the 29-county area, as well as a number of additional roads that were identified by ARC's Transportation Planning Division (TPD) as major roads. Please note, this Layer is intended for relatively small scale mapping and labeling, and should be used in conjunction with the Expressways Layer. For more information on the DLGF streetbase, refer to the metadata for ARstreets and Streets.","",

"Address GIS data for Fulton County, GA and the City of Atlanta","Address points are intended as a comprehensive collection of all addresses in Fulton County and the City of Atlanta represented as point locations. The locations generally represent the drveway access to properties, thus the commonly used name 'Driveway Access Points', or 'Daccess' for short.

The primary source of address points are development plats approved through Fulton County and the City of Atlanta. Addresses are also updated as a result of address changes processed by the County and it's municipalities. The address points are maintained primarily by Fulton County GIS, with contributions from the GIS Division of the City of Atlanta Department of Planning and Community Development.","HOUSING",
