"Major Roads (Atlanta, GA)","This layer was developed by the Research & Analytics Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission and is a subset of the Georgia Department of Transportation's (GDOT) DLGF street centerline database. The features included in this Layer consist of all State highways in the 29-county area, as well as a number of additional roads that were identified by ARC's Transportation Planning Division (TPD) as major roads. Please note, this Layer is intended for relatively small scale mapping and labeling, and should be used in conjunction with the Expressways Layer. For more information on the DLGF streetbase, refer to the metadata for ARstreets and Streets.","","https://brigades.opendatanetwork.com/d/c7cs-g3xa"
